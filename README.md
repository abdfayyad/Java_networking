This project aims to establish a secure client-server communication system for Damascus University using Java. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authentication. Features include user registration/login, symmetric encryption, PGP hybrid encryption, digital signatures, and certificate-based authentication.

This repository contains a secure Java-based client-server communication system for Damascus University. Key features:

Authentication: Users (Students, Teachers) register/login securely.
Encryption: Utilizes symmetric (AES) and PGP hybrid encryption for data confidentiality.
Digital Signature: Ensures data integrity and non-repudiation using the university doctor's signature.
Certificate-based Authentication: Implements CA-signed certificates for mutual verification between entities.
Usage: Detailed instructions to set up, run, and deploy the system are provided.
